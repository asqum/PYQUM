    "Cross entropy benchmarking of two qubits (XEB) is a method for characterizing the fidelity of a two-qubit gate.\n",
    "The XEB sequence consists of a random sequence of single-qubit gates and a two-qubit gate, followed by a measurement.\n",
    "The sequence is repeated many times, and the results are used to calculate the cross entropy between the ideal and measured states.\n",
    "The cross entropy is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions, and is related to the fidelity of the two-qubit gate.\n",
    "The cross entropy is calculated as follows:\n",
    "    1. The ideal state is calculated by applying the sequence of single-qubit gates and the two-qubit gate to the initial state |00>.\n",
    "    2. The measured state is calculated by applying the sequence of single-qubit gates to the initial state |00>, followed by a measurement.\n",
    "    3. The cross entropy is calculated between the ideal and measured states.\n",
    "The cross entropy is calculated for a range of sequence depths, and the results are used to calculate the fidelity of the two-qubit gate.\n",
    "In this script, we provide an example of how to run an XEB sequence on the OPX.\n",
